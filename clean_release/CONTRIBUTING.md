        self.x = x
        self.y = y
        self.active = True
    
    def update(self, delta_time):
        """Update component state
        
        Args:
            delta_time (float): Time elapsed since last update
        """
        if not self.active:

## üéÆ Game Architecture

### Core Components
- **Game**: Main game controller and state management
- **Jeep**: Player character with physics and rendering
- **Animal**: Wildlife system with various animal types
- **Obstacle**: Terrain obstacles (rocks and logs)
- **Menu**: Main menu system with navigation
- **RefuelMenu**: Fuel station interface

### Key Systems
- **Collision Detection**: Smart system for top vs side collisions
- **Fuel Management**: Strategic resource management
- **State Management**: Menu, playing, paused, refuel states
- **Rendering Pipeline**: Efficient graphics rendering

## üé® Art and Design Guidelines

### Visual Style
- Maintain retro pixel art aesthetic
- Use thick black outlines (2-4 pixels)
- Follow the established color palette
- Keep animations minimal and non-distracting

### Color Palette
```python
RETRO_BLACK = (0, 0, 0)
RETRO_WHITE = (255, 255, 255)
RETRO_YELLOW = (255, 255, 0)
MILITARY_GREEN = (85, 107, 47)
JUNGLE_GREEN = (34, 139, 34)
```

## üß™ Testing

### Manual Testing
- Test all menu navigation
- Verify collision detection works correctly
- Check fuel and health systems
- Test pause/resume functionality
- Ensure refuel system works

### Performance Testing
- Maintain 60 FPS during gameplay
- Check memory usage doesn't grow over time
- Verify smooth scrolling and animations
